# <img src="../../Sylvan.png" height="48" alt="Sylvan Logo"/> Sylvan.Data.XBase

The fastest "XBase" data reader available for .NET. XBase is a file format used by DBase, FoxPro, and Clipper database applications which were popular in the '90s. It still used as the storage format for metadata in ESRI shape files.

Sylvan.Data.XBase provides a forward-only reader that allows reading data over a non-seekable stream. This means that it is possible to read records directly out of a zip archive, which is common for shapefiles. Memo data does not neccessarily support forward only reading, but shape files don't normally include memo data. This library does not currently support writing XBase files, it only supports reading.
