# Sylvan.Data.Csv Release Notes

_1.3.4_
- Adds `CsvSchema.Dynamic` which treats CSV data as having "variant" type. This can be useful when processing
    CSV data where the field type might change from row to row.
- Adds per-column string factory to `CsvDataReader` via `CsvDataReaderOptions.ColumnStringFactory`.

_1.3.3_
- CsvDataReader.Create now accepts a CancellationToken to support async cancellation during construction.

_1.3.2_
- Improve SIMD code path for significant performance gains. Thanks to [nietras](https://github.com/nietras/sep)
  and their impressive sep library for inspiration and learning.

_1.3.1_
- Add support for reading CSV files that use '\r' as line terminators.
- CsvDataWriter now defaults to writing '\n', regardless of platform.

_1.3.0_
- Drop support for netcoreapp3.0.
- Fixes CsvDataReader reading of empty enum fields.
- Add CsvDataReader support for reading "dynamic" object-typed data, where each row might contain
    different typed values.

_1.2.7_
- Fixes a bug in CsvDataWriter when writing `long` values from an untyped data source.

_1.2.6_
- CsvDataWriter handles `DbDataReader` implementations that don't fully expose schema information.
- CsvDataWriter uses appropriate formatting when processing data that is not uniformly typed.

_1.2.5_

- CsvDataReader now identifies empty quoted fields (`""`) as null when a 
   strongly-typed schema indicates the column is a nullable non-string type.
- Adds CsvDataReader.Initialize method which allows re-initializing the schema.
	Supports handling files that have extra rows at the start of the file.

_1.2.4_

- CsvDataWriter avoids array allocation for default configuration.
- Adds missing `ConfigureAwait` calls.
- Fixes some issues where invalid CSV data could be written in some cultures.

_1.2.3_

- Fixes accessing enum values via the `GetValue` accessor. Thanks to [0xced](https://github.com/0xced).

_1.2.2_

- CsvSchema allows renaming columns when BaseColumnName is set.

_1.2.1_

- Adds MaxBufferSize option to CsvDataWriter, which allows internal buffer to grow when necessary.
- Change buffering behavior of CsvDataWriter to have symmetry with CsvDataReader. It was previously possible to write CSV files that could not be read back with the same configuration. This was because the internal buffer for the writer only required that the current field fit in the buffer, while the reader requires the entire record (all fields). The CsvDataWriter now buffers an entire record instead.
- Allow accessing extra columns via CsvDataReader.GetValue().
- Fix DateOnly and TimeOnly custom formatting in CsvDataWriter.
- CsvDataReader.GetValue will return DateOnly/TimeOnly when specified by schema.
- CsvDataWriterOptions.DateFormat is marked obsolete, replace with DateTimeFormat.
- Add CsvDataWriter.QuoteEmptyStrings to indicate that empty strings should be written as empty quotes instead of an empty field.

_1.2.0_

- Adds MaxBufferSize option to CsvDataReader, which allows the internal buffer to grow when necessary. 
  Defaults to `null`, which disallows growth, and is consistent with the previous behavior.
- Adds `ICsvSchemaProvider.GetFieldCount()` which gives the provider the ability to explicitly
  control the number of columns. 
  Previously, the field count of the current row would be used to determine the number of
  columns. This is an (unlikely) breaking change for users on .NET framework, who will need
  to provide an implementation.
- Add CsvSchemaProvider base implementation of ICsvSchemaProvider. Implementers should prefer the abstract base to avoid potential future breaking changes.
- Add `CsvDataReaderOptions.DateTimeFormat` to replace `DateFormat` which is now `Obsolete`.
- Add `CsvDataReaderOptions.DateOnlyFormat` to allow globally specifying the format for parsing DateOnly values.
- Improve the performance of CsvDataReader async operations in some scenarios.

_1.1.16_

- CsvDataWriter support for writing variable field count.
- CsvDataReader no longer skips empty leading rows in SingleResult mode.

_1.1.15_

- Fix for CSV comment not being terminated, and being included in subsequent row.

_1.1.14_

- Fix for reading CSV file containing a comment at the end of the file with no line terminator.

_1.1.13_

- Expose `CsvDataReader.GetFieldSpan`.

_1.1.12_

_1.1.11_

- Fix an issue where the final field in a file would be read incorrectly if it was both quoted and there was no trailing newline.

_1.1.10_

- Fix behavior when handling empty files and HasHeader option is false.

_1.1.9_

- Add support for writing Enum values via CsvDataWriter.
- CsvDataReaderOptions and CsvDataWriterOptions `Buffer` property moved to be a separate parameter to constructors. 
Existing options property continues to work, but marked `Obsolete`. 
This was done to allow options objects to be reused, but the buffer can't be shared between instances.
- CsvDataWriterOptions allows configuring binary format.

_1.1.8_

- Support custom formatting for CsvDataReader DateTimeOffset, DateOnly, TimeOnly, and TimeSpan.
- Fixes #79: `MultiResult` mode now correctly handles cases where a header row can exist without following data rows.

_1.1.7_

- Fix for SIMD logic when encountering a quote that would cause incorrect number of records to be identified.
- Fix issue with final character in file being a quote.
- Increase the default buffer size for CsvDataReader and CsvDataWriter from 4k to 16k to be able handle
more extreme scenarios without requiring configuration.

_1.1.6_

- Improve performance of CsvDataReader SIMD logic on AMD Zen2 architecture.

_1.1.5_

- Fix regression introduced in 1.1.4.

_1.1.4_

- Improve CsvDataReader performance in some scenarios.

_1.0.3_

- Fix CsvDataWriter not writing certain types when writing the value would span a buffer.

_1.0.2_

- Fix CsvDataWriter.WriteAsync to consume the data reader asynchronously with `ReadAsync` instead of `Read`, 
which caused failures when used in ASP.NET Core where synchronous IO is disallowed by default.
- Seal CsvDataWriter class.
- Fix bug that could allow reading invalid hex binary data, will now throw an exception instead of producing invalid result.

_1.0.1_

- Adds support for Unquoted style to CsvDataWriter.

- Add WriteHeader option to CsvDataWriterOptions.
- Performance improvements for real-world usage scenarios. Micro-benchmark measurements remain stable.

_0.8.0_

- Add some nullability annotations to align with new annotations exposed in net5.0.
	Most notably, this means that schema column names can no longer be reported as null, 
	but will instead be empty string when no headers are present.
